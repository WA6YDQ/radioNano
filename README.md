Update to radioUno - arduino control of a radio

This repository is a complete re-write to the radio uno project pblished earlier.
radioNano v1
 *  
 *  (C) Kurt Theis 2022 WA6YDQ
 *  This is a controller for an HF radio using qrp-labs.com 
 *  receiver module, polyphasor module and their si5351 osc.
 *  For an audio amp I use an LM386 with no extra gain (the poly-
 *  phasor has plenty of audio output).
 *  
 *  This is the replacement to Radio Uno, previously published
 *  by me on github. 
 *  In this version I use the etherkit si5351 drivers. Easy to 
 *  setup and use, ability to enable/disable indiv outputs.
 *  
 *  I also use (instead of the Arduino Uno) the Arduino Nano,
 *  hence the name change. Gives me a couple of extra analog
 *  inputs and is 1/3 the price.
 
 See the defined pin numbers for the hardware description. A schematic
 will be uploaded later. This software has been in continous use
 since 3/2022 with only minor changes. 
 
 This repository is used as off-site backup for now. Consider this as
 beta - working but subject to change.
